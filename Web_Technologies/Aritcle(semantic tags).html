          Online education is a form of education where students use their home
          computers through the internet. For many nontraditional students,
          among them all those who want to continue working full time or raising
          families, online graduations and courses have become popular in the
          past decade. Often, online degree programs and courses are offered by
          online-only institutions as well as the online programs of many

        <h3 id="overview">Why Online Education</h3>
        <p>
          Online education offers flexibility for students to learn at their own
          pace and in their own environment. The need for flexibility has
          increased as more students juggle full-time jobs and other
          responsibilities with their studies. With online courses, students can
          gain an education without having to physically attend classes on a
          campus.
